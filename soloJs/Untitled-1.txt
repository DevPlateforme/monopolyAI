So, the AI :

checks if direct monopolies are obtainable.

If yes, they are on top of the propositionList.


To calculate them, we simply exactly use that algorithm. 


So , nothing to change at all. (computing static values);


Then => If we can get a 2/3 or a 1/3 => After that, can I get a direct trade with another player?

So, exactly that way.


If I can make a trade, it will be counted as 80% of gain. 

So, if I think in one round : I'll think in one round for the opponent as well.

I'll say : I'll propose this opponent all my sets, and I'll try to get one allowing me to get to those 80%.



//direct monopolies 
     profitableTrade(){

         if direct monopolies static, it means that, when the other player will simulate this move, he'll perceive its situation couldnt be better.

     }


     So, I always think one step ahead. But one step ahead, this value will be computed as 100% 



I say => getGain += 100%;

So, personnally, I'll choose to get those 100% , rather than 80%;


In this case, I'll inform the human he'll benefit from it. Else, if I get a 80% , I won't tell the player
