I dont want :

4 trains / 0 - 2/3 => how can that deal be fair? 

Let's check, as there was an issue.


There is a limit in the cash I ask, as cash is only an addition;


Why did the AI refuse



100 combinations :

public services

Mortgage

train combinations

What I want : (calculation)

(from 0t);

That 1 property + 300 dollars == 1 train

That 2 trains + 150d == 2 properties

That 1/3 to 3/3t == 2 properties + 300 dollars 


AIs focus on 


Normally, we said ; we want to go from 0/3 , 1/3 ... when we have to trick , we do...

Now there are trains, which are sets as well.

So, AIs focus first on properties, but doesnt neglect trains.

Meaning, if there is a way to give 1 house to a player, to get a 2/3, we are willing for example to give a public service.






(A partir de là, on multiplie et on en arrivera à des heuristics)



So, 1 property/3 + 250 dollars = 1/0 public service ; 



1ps = 1t + 250

4 t = 1brown_p + 600

1/0 property + 500 dollars = 1/0 train ;

1/0 public service + 250 dollars = 1/0 train ;

4 trains + 600 dollars = une propriété brown


properties (trains) :

(values are unmortgaged. Mortgaged properties see their value diminished by 20%);

1p + 400 = 1t
2p = 2t + 300 / 2p = 3t
3p (ou 2) = 4t + 800 (pour brown)

1p + 250 = 1ps
2p = 2t
3p = 2t


Donc, m IA est pret à payer + 2t , pour avoir 2p, mais on a une souplesse 1 à 1.3 , donc ok.




---------


Donc, 

1 train => 1 train , false

1 train => 1 train + 500 dollars, ok;
